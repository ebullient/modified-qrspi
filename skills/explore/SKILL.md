# QRSPI Explore

## Core Philosophy
- Survey and propose options; do not commit to a feature.
- Optional: skip it when the feature is clear and use `qrspi-x:init`. It is not part of the linear workflow and creates no `state.json`.

## Task
Before spawning, prefer the declared agent when the runtime supports named agents:

- If `qrspi-x:explorer` is registered, spawn it directly so the runtime can apply its declared settings.
- Otherwise, read `../../agents/explorer.md`, resolved relative to this `SKILL.md`, and spawn a generic subagent with its full contents as the role instructions.

In either case, pass an exploration name and topic:

```
If registered: Spawn qrspi-x:explorer agent for exploration: <exploration-name>
Otherwise: Role instructions: <contents of ../../agents/explorer.md>; spawn a generic subagent for exploration: <exploration-name>
Topic: <area of interest, e.g. "what does <reference framework> provide that this extension doesn't yet adapt">
```

The agent surveys broadly, forms opinions, and proposes candidate directions. It stays in the current project unless the topic explicitly names a local reference or upstream path.

Using a subagent keeps exploratory reads out of the main conversation.

## After the Agent Returns
1. Review its observations, gaps, candidate directions, and open questions.
2. Stop for human review of `./qrspi/explore/<exploration-name>/explore.md`.
3. If a direction is worth pursuing, start `qrspi-x:init` with a specific feature name; optionally provide `explore.md` as context.

Do not write request.md, generate queries, or otherwise start the normal QRSPI flow automatically — Explore only produces the survey.
