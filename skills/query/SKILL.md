# QRSPI Query

## Core Philosophy
- Only generate questions, nothing else
- Questions come from the feature request, not the codebase - exploring the code to ground or answer questions is Research's job, not Query's
- Not every question is for Research - some are about intent only the requester can resolve; those get asked and answered directly, then folded into request.md, never left sitting in queries.md

This skill is part of the QRSPI workflow and is normally invoked by `qrspi-x:workflow`. It may also be invoked directly.

## The helper
Helper installation, recovery, and artifact-only fallback are defined by `qrspi-x:workflow`. Query has no `qrspi-x` state of its own; when the helper is available it's used only for backup naming on a regeneration and for recording why, per the Task steps below. If it exits 127, continue this interactive step without it. Never edit any helper state manually.

## Task
Always generate `queries.md` with the `qrspi-x:query` agent, so question generation happens in isolation from the codebase and from anything already explored in this conversation (research findings, a prior feature's work, earlier tool calls, etc.). Never write or append questions to `queries.md` yourself.

1. Check `./qrspi/<feature>/request.md`.
   - If it exists, read it — this is the feature intent to pass to the agent.
   - If it doesn't exist, route back through `qrspi-x:init` to capture the request before continuing. Preserve any optional human context in `background.md` through Init.
2. Determine the mode before moving any artifact:
   - **Initial** — no `queries.md` exists.
   - **Refinement** — this pass follows Research whose `research.md` has a non-empty `## New Questions` section.
   - **Regeneration** — `queries.md` exists and Query is being rerun after clarification, a backward jump, or an explicit request to revise questions.
3. If `queries.md` exists, retain its complete contents and move it to `./qrspi/<feature>/backups/queries-<n>.md`, where `n` is one greater than the highest `n` already present for the `queries` stem, starting at 1 (if the helper is available, `qrspi-x next-file query --feature <feature> --project <path>` returns this path directly — same result, no need to list `backups/` and compute `n` by hand). Never rename, rotate, or overwrite an existing backup — writing one is always a pure addition. Create `backups/` only when there is something to put in it. The agent can write a fresh file but cannot overwrite the old one.
4. Before spawning, prefer the declared agent when the runtime supports named agents:
   - If `qrspi-x:query` is registered, spawn it directly so the runtime can apply its declared settings.
   - Otherwise, read `../../agents/query.md`, resolved relative to this `SKILL.md`, and spawn a general-purpose subagent with its full contents as the role instructions.

   In either case, include the feature name and `request.md` verbatim. In refinement mode, also pass prior queries and New Questions verbatim. In regeneration mode, pass prior queries verbatim and preserve still-relevant questions. Pass any post-Spec questions verbatim as `Additional questions from the human`; do not summarize, answer, or add research findings:

```
If registered: Spawn qrspi-x:query agent
Otherwise: Role instructions: <contents of ../../agents/query.md>; spawn a general-purpose subagent
Feature: <feature-name>
Mode: <initial | refinement | regeneration>
Feature request: <contents of request.md>
Prior queries: <contents of the moved-aside queries.md — refinement or regeneration>
New questions from research: <verbatim ## New Questions list — refinement only>
Additional questions from the human: <verbatim list, if any>
```

The agent has no tools beyond `Write` — it cannot read files, grep, or run commands, so it cannot cite file paths, class names, or "confirmed via" findings. If output like that shows up in queries.md, question generation didn't stay isolated and the step should be re-run.

## After the Agent Returns
1. Read the agent's report for question counts and any Questions for the User.
2. If there are Questions for the User, append them to `request.md` under `## Open Questions` (create the section if needed; preserve the original request), then ask them. Move each answered question to `## Clarifications` with its answer. This revises intent, not `queries.md`.
3. If `## Clarifications` changed in step 2, rerun in Regeneration mode so `queries.md` reflects the clarified intent while preserving still-relevant questions.
4. Once a pass comes back with no Questions for the User, stop and wait for human review of `./qrspi/<feature>/queries.md`. Do not treat unanswered Open Questions as resolved; Spec will block on them.
5. If the helper is available and this is a regeneration worth recording, note why with `qrspi-x history add --feature <feature> --project <path> --text "<why>"`.

Do not proceed to research or any other step automatically.
